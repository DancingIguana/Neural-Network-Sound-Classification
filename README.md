# Neural-Network-Sound-Classification

Some neural network models built with *fastai*, *fastaudio* and *pytorch* to classify data of speech commands. There are different neural networks used through the Notebook. The first type of models pass the signal waveform into a spectrogram and perform image classification through convolutional neural netowrks. The other type of models receive the signal waveform directly and perform the classification.
